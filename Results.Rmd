## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be **generated** that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the `r 2+3` code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r include = FALSE}

# colorFunc <- "heat.colors"
colorFunc <- "terrain.colors"
# colorFunc <- "topo.colors"
# colorFunc <- "cm.colors"
# colorFunc <- "rainbow"
```

Base R comes with many functions for generating colors. The code below demonstrates the `r colorFunc` function. 

## `r colorFunc`

```{r fig.cap = "The Maunga Whau volcano.", echo = FALSE}
image(volcano, col = get(colorFunc)(200))


```
